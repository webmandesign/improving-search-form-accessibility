Improves search form accessibility by associating search field label explicitly instead of implicitly.


== Description ==

WordPress [search form](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_search_form/) associates [label with search field implicitly](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#associating-labels-implicitly). This can cause issues with certain assistive technologies.

This plugin fixes the issue by [associating the label explicitly](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#associating-labels-explicitly), thus effectively improving WordPress search form accessibility.

There are no options for the plugin, it works out of the box.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin download file and upload `improving-search-form-accessibility` folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the *"Plugins"* menu in WordPress.
3. Plugin has no options, works immediately after activation.
